As a recent Computer Science graduate, Iâ€™ve been diving deep into creating dynamic simulations and exploring the power of DirectX. I built a particle collision simulation from scratch, adding interactive features that make the project both educational and fun to use. Here are some highlights:

ðŸ”¹ Particle Control: Use arrow keys to move a green particle and control all particles by clicking and launching them with the mouse. 
ðŸ”¹ Dynamic Particle Management: Easily add or delete particles in real-time. 
ðŸ”¹ Spring Effect: Press "S" to activate a spring effect, transforming particles into a polygonal shape. This dynamic spring constraint makes the particles behave like a connected jelly or slime, bouncing off walls and maintaining the polygon shape. 

By specifying the spring length, you can make the particles form any desired shape. I designed a specific formula that generates the spring length automatically for regular n-sided polygons, along with an equation to help determine if the mouse is inside the polygon. This method can be more efficient than ray-casting in this specific case.

In this project, I utilized basic Linear Algebra concepts and physics equations to bring these features to life, all out of curiosity and passion for learning.
Check out the demo video showcasing the project in action.

I'm eager to apply my skills and passion for software engineering in a professional setting. If you're looking for someone who loves tackling complex and interesting projects, let's connect! ðŸš€
